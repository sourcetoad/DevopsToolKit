# Sourcetoad Internal Development Tools (SIDT)

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/sourcetoad/DevopsToolKit/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

Sourcetoad Internal Development Tools includes a growing collection of tutorials
for managing IDEs, hooking up tools with Docker and any combination of those
things.

Additionally, this repository holds our data source services which is
a collection of databases and other services that projects will more than likely
need. It also provides a proxy setup via nginx-proxy so that multiple projects
can be run at the same time without the need for different ports.

This means docker configurations for each project only needs to worry about the
language and other tools it may need, as the databases and other services are
standardized in this project. Since most cloud providers provide managed versions
of these services, you likely would not use a docker version of them in production.
